The server mfs actually holds the inodes, so the first step is 
to delegate the system call originally to vfs to mfs. Inside mfs, 
there is a routine read_map that maps a position in a file to its 
disk block number. The implementation of Task 2 simply repeatedly 
calls read_map with positions with a stride of block size and prints
the result. The "SZ: A VS B*C" after the printed disk block list
shows the file size A, the number of blocks printed B, and the block
sie C to verify that all blocks are printed ( A<=B*C and A>(B-1)*C ).
