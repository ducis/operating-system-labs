The program t0 (t0.c) prints messages as required in Task 1 and Task 2.
Usage:
	./t0 path_to_file
The program h0 (t0.c) opens a file twice and holds the 2 file descriptors 
for one minuteto help testing Task 1
Usage:
	./h0 path_to_file
To make both, just type
	make all
The script gen.sh generates files of exponentially increasing sizes("sample0" 
to "sample9") from the file "seed"
The script try.sh automatically runs one to three instances of h0 with "sample0"
and runs t0 to verify Task 1. It also tests t0 over "sample1" to "sample9" to 
verify Task 2.
Finally, there is an all-in-one script called runtests.sh, which calls make,gen.sh
and try.sh
