I simply added a small random (different on each run) offset (0 to -178) 
to the starting address of the stack top when starting a process. 
Because calling timing services on the startup of the first or every 
processes causes problems (even clock()), srand() is not called on pm 
startup, neither is the offset computed from some time. The starting 
address of the stack when running the test program as specified in the 
pdf does pseudo-randomly change.
